# First-machine-learning-project-Predicting-hours-of-earn-per-week
## Overview:
this is a project that includes data cleaning,data visualization(with interpretations),data pre-processing and machine learning using two models:randomforest and linearregression.
## Objective:
the goal is to train two different models to predict the hours of earn per week for each adult and compare the margin of error.
## Dataset:
This dataset is uploaded on kaggle under the name of "Income dataset" since its goal was to predict the income >50K or <=50k.It's mainly a dataset containing data that revolves around the customers of a bank,its columns are:
* age
* workclass
* fnlwgt
* education
* educational-num
* marital-status
* occupation
* relationship
* race
* gender
* capital-gain
* capital-loss
* hours-per-week
* native-country
## Methodology:
This project utilizes supervised learning, a branch of machine learning where algorithms learn from labeled data. In supervised learning, we provide the model with both input data (features) and the corresponding desired output (target variable).The model then learns to identify patterns and relationships within this data, enabling it to make predictions for new, unseen data.Within this project,We will be predicting the hours of earn per week (hours-per-week) using two different models:
* #### LinearRegression:
Linear regression is a statistical method that models a linear relationship between a dependent variable (in our case hours-per-week) and one or more independent variables (the remaining features obviously).
* #### RandomForest:
It combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Each decision tree is a series of yes/no questions that lead to a final prediction.
